<h2>Mini-FAQ</h2>
<h3>What is Date::Pcalc?</h3>
<p>
This Perl module is a direct translation of
<a href="mailto:sb@engelschall.com">Steffen
Beyer</a>'s excellent
<a href="http://www.engelschall.com/u/sb/download">Date::Calc</a> module
to use Perl only instead of a combination of Perl and C.
<p>
This package consists of a Perl module
for all kinds of date calculations based
on the Gregorian calendar (the one used in all western countries today),
thereby complying with all relevant norms and standards: ISO/R 2015-1971,
DIN 1355 and, to some extent, ISO 8601 (where applicable).
</p>
<h3>Why did you rewrite a perfectly good module?</h3>
<p>
I was working on  a project that required date calculations.  Date::Calc did
exactly what I wanted, but the client's ISP would not allow me to
compile C code.  I rewrote the few subroutines that I needed into
Perl, and then decided to translate the entire module to Perl in
case other people encountered the same problem.
</p>
<h3>Why is the module so huge?</h3>
<p>
Since I've made the module match the original as closely as possible
(in terms of function calls, etc.), I decided to
use Mr. Beyer's documentation with slight modifications.  I am also
using two of his subroutines verbatim. This being the case,
the GPL requires me to
redistribute the entire package. I've included the original package
in the <code>Calc_original</code> subdirectory of this distribution.
</p>
<h3>Whom do I complain to if it doesn't work?</h3>
<p>
To <a href="mailto:david@catcode.com?subject=Date::Pcalc doesn't work">me</a>,
of course.  Any errors you find in the module have
undboutedly been introduced by my translation from C to Perl.
