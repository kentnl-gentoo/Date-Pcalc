Many very special thanks for his tremendous work to J. David Eisenberg
<david@catcode.com> for writing a plain Perl version of Date::Calc 4.3,
available from his home page at http://catcode.com/date/pcalc.html!

Many thanks to Marek Snowarski <Marek.Snowarski@grzyby.pl> for
raising my attention to the fact that the Polish names for the
months and days of week were written wrongly.

Many thanks to Piotr Wierzejewski <nlexposure@gmail.com> for
providing me with the correct spelling of the Polish names
for the months and days of week in Unicode.
