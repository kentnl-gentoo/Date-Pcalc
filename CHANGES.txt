Version history:
----------------

Version 1.2   02 Apr 2001

 +  Cosmetic changes to accompanying text files
 +  "Flattened" the directory structure to make PAUSE and its
    maintainer more happy :-)

Version 1.1   06 Feb 2000

 +  Added year windowing (yy < 70 ? 20yy : 19yy) to Decode_Date_EU2
    and Decode_Date_US2
 +  Added English_Ordinal for use in Date_to_Text_Long
 +  Updated documentation to match Date::Calc version 4.3
 +  Added various fixes to Pcalc.pm from Steffen Beyer, mostly
    involving optimizing use of returned lists

Version 1.0   03 Aug 1999

 +  First release of module. I wrote this module because I was doing
    a project that required date calculations.  Date::Calc did
    exactly what I wanted, but the client's ISP would not allow me to
    compile C code.  I rewrote the few subroutines that I needed into
    Perl, and then decided to translate the entire module to Perl in
    case other people encountered the same problem.
