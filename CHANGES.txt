Version history:
----------------

Version 6.1   15.10.2009

 +  United "Date::Calc" and "Date::Pcalc" into a single distribution
 +  Fixed Polish names of months and days of week (RT ticket #14159)

Version 6.0   07-Oct-2009   Copyright (c) by Steffen Beyer

 +  Complete rewrite based on Date::Calc version 6.0
    (Note that this is a 1:1 transcription and that it should
    therefore behave exactly like the original Date::Calc module)
 +  BEWARE that the system call "mktime()" is not available in
    Perl; therefore, "Mktime()" in this module does not call it,
    but tries to calculate the same result on its own. This works
    on my machine (for some tested dates), but no guarantees can be
    given it will work on yours (and for other dates and locations).

Version 1.2   02-Apr-2001   Copyright (c) by J. David Eisenberg

 +  Cosmetic changes to accompanying text files
 +  "Flattened" the directory structure to make PAUSE and its
    maintainer more happy :-)

Version 1.1   06-Feb-2000   Copyright (c) by J. David Eisenberg

 +  Added year windowing (yy < 70 ? 20yy : 19yy) to Decode_Date_EU2
    and Decode_Date_US2
 +  Added English_Ordinal for use in Date_to_Text_Long
 +  Updated documentation to match Date::Calc version 4.3
 +  Added various fixes to Pcalc.pm from Steffen Beyer, mostly
    involving optimizing use of returned lists

Version 1.0   03-Aug-1999   Copyright (c) by J. David Eisenberg

 +  First release of module. I wrote this module because I was doing
    a project that required date calculations.  Date::Calc did
    exactly what I wanted, but the client's ISP would not allow me to
    compile C code.  I rewrote the few subroutines that I needed into
    Perl, and then decided to translate the entire module to Perl in
    case other people encountered the same problem.
