Version history:
----------------
Version 1.1   06 Feb 2000

 +  Added year windowing (yy < 70 ? 20yy : 19yy) to Decode_Date_EU2
    and Decode_Date_US2
 +  Added English_Ordinal for use in Date_to_Text_Long
 +  Updated documentation to match Date::Calc version 4.3
 +  Added various fixes to PCalc.pm from Steffen Beyer, mostly
    involving optimizing use of returned lists

Version 1.0   03 Aug 1999

 +  First release of module. I wrote this module because I was doing
 	a project that required date calculations.  Date::Calc did
	exactly what I wanted, but the client's ISP would not allow me to
	compile C code.  I rewrote the few subroutines that I needed into
	Perl, and then decided to translate the entire module to Perl in
	case other people encountered the same problem.
